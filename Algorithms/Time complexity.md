Algorithms performance is measure in time over amount of things to process.

It's denoted with O(n)
Big O - time.
n - number.

Some other examples.

O(n/2)
Runs twice as fast but has linear property meaning time complexity directly scales with amount of data processed.

O(log(n))
Is a logarithmic algorithm which does not have linear scaling, with increase in data it has a very low increase in time complexity.

O(1)
Constant O of 1 meaning It doesn't change time complexity, It's always the same run time.

O(2^n)
Exponential, meaning as data increases the algorithm slows down exponentionaly, very bad...
