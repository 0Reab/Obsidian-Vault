Bash scripting is a language for interacting with your shell command interpreter.

Why not use python?
Because bash can directly call any binaries that are powerful for text processing like sed or awk.
Bash can also utilize your global env variables like $USER, $PWD, $SHELL, $HOME...

Learning bash will help you be efficient in your terminal.
