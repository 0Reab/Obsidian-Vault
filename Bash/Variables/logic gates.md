In bash scripting using logic gates to make one-liners or further develop your ability to script:
		1. || - OR
		2. && - AND

Here are some example for usage of && *and* gate.

```bash
if [ -f text.txt ] && [ -d textdir ]; then
	mv text.txt /textdir
fi
```
In this example we are checking if file "text.txt" exists && and if directory "textdir" exists.
If both of these statements evaluate to true, the mv command block will be executed.
In case only one statement is true and other is not, mv command block will not be executed.

If we were to replace && to || or operator in this code snippet.
The mv command block will be executed if either one of the statements is true.
That would make this a buggy code, but you get the point how to use || or gate.

Don't forget you can use these operators in your regular shell, like chaining a sequence of commands with &&, or setting up a logic gate with or gate.
