Vim motions on a high level overview are split in 3 modes.
[[Command]]
[[Number]]
[[Motion]]

(In that order).

The idea is to combine all the three modes and combine them into a single action.

For example in Insert mode (where you actually type text) switching to command mode can be done via, ESC, ctrl + c, ctrl + o.

Arrow keys equivalent at this moment is jk for up down and hl for left right.
So combining those movement keys with numbers will act as a multiplier.
Simply pressing 3j will move 3 times down, 3h will move three times left.
