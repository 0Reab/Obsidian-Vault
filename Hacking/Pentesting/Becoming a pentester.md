Understaning ROI (rules of engagement).
Following your ROI, morals and ethics.
To not break any law and work for a goal of improving the security.
```

ROI consist of permission, test scope and rules.

Because each pentest is different.
All methodologies follow these stages in one way or another.

- Information gathering (passive, not interacting with the target).
- Enumeration / Scanning (active, finding open ports, fingerprinting etc.)
- Exploitation (leveraging a vulnerability to gain access to the system)
- Privilege escalation (Gaining root/admin privileges on the system)
- Post-exploitation (Pivoting the network, info gathering, covering tracks, reporting)

**OSSTMM**

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
(https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) 
provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

1. **Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)**
2. Wired Networks
3. Wireless communications

**OWASP**

The "[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

The foundation regularly [writes reports](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/) stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1**

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

**NCSC CAF**

The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance) (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When doing a pentest the hacker will have some amount of existing knowledge of the target.

Ranging from none, partial, full.

These are called:

Black box - no knowledge.
Grey box - partial knowledge.
White box - full knowledge.
