Places to start the journey:

**PortSwigger Academy**: Focuses on web security labs that teach you common vulnerabilities in depth, especially relevant for web application bounties.


**Hacker101 CTF by HackerOne**: This is a CTF that lets you simulate bug bounty hunting on various "levels" of vulnerable applications.
You can earn invites to private programs on HackerOne by completing these challenges, which can help you enter paid programs with less competition.


Some less popular platforms like **YesWeHack** or **Synack Red Team** (though Synack has an application process) can sometimes be less competitive.
**Open Bug Bounty** is another option; it’s free to join, focuses primarily on web vulnerabilities, and typically has less competitive programs.


- Many companies have **VDPs** instead of bounty programs, meaning they allow security research but don’t pay for findings. These are easier to get started with, and the stakes are lower, which can mean less competition.
- **Where to find them**: Use **Disclose.io**, a directory of organizations with VDPs that welcome responsible disclosure. Companies listed here allow you to ethically test without needing bounty platform access.


- **HackerOne and Bugcrowd** have some free programs, though they can be competitive. However, if you focus on **programs with low payouts (or those with no monetary reward at all)**, you may find bugs that experienced hunters skip over due to low incentives.
- **Intigriti** also has a beginner-friendly approach with educational content and some programs open to newcomers.
- **HackerOne Hacktivity**: This section lets you see disclosed reports and learn from past submissions. It’s a good way to understand what has already been reported so you can identify overlooked areas in other programs.


- **Where to start**: Many open-source projects welcome security contributions, and reporting issues here can be a great way to get started. Look for projects that state they’re open to security research or have a defined **security policy** on GitHub. Projects without policies also sometimes appreciate responsible disclosure if you find something critical.
- **Why it’s a good choice**: You can find less competition here compared to commercial bug bounty platforms, and it allows you to build up public "street cred" since your contributions can be seen by others in the community.
- **Example tools**: Check out repositories on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and look at those with high stars and low issue counts (indicating they’re active and maintained).
