32bit
```C
call - call x to execute
jmp - unconditional jump to x mem addr
push - pushes the date of cpu register to onoto the stack
push ebp - saves base pointer
mov ebp, esp - set new base pointer value
sub - subtracts val1 from val2 and stores in val2
eax - extended acumulator for arithmetic, storing return vals or logic ops
esi - source index 
edi - desitantion index register str/mem arr copying and for far pointer addresing
mov edi, edi - non op that can be overwritten
je - jump if equal
jne - jump if not equal
jl - jump if less
jae - jump if above or equal
leave - reverse the action of enter instruction
pop - removes last value pushed on stack and puts it in register
ret - transfer control to the return addr on the stack
int3 - software breakpoint (interuption) 
```

`dword ptr ss:[ebp-0C]=[00BDF794]=0`

1. **`dword ptr`**: This specifies that the operation is working with a "double word" (i.e., 32 bits or 4 bytes of data).
2. **`ss:[ebp-0C]`**: This indicates that the destination is a memory location relative to the stack frame pointer (`ebp`). Specifically, it's the address at `ebp - 0x0C`, which is 12 bytes below the current base pointer (`ebp`). This location is on the stack.
    - **`ebp`** is often used as a frame pointer for referencing local variables or function parameters in assembly code. The stack grows downward, so subtracting from `ebp` accesses local variables.
3. **`[00BDF794]`**: This looks like the value at memory address `00BDF794`, which in this case, is a literal value of `0` that will be stored into the location `ss:[ebp-0C]`. 

### What does it do?

This line of assembly is storing the value `0` into the memory location at `ebp - 0x0C`. In high-level terms, this likely corresponds to setting a local variable or function parameter to `0`. Specifically:

- The address `[ebp - 0x0C]` might be where a local variable is stored on the stack.
- The `dword ptr` ensures that a 32-bit value is being written (in this case, `0`).

`int local_variable = 0;`
