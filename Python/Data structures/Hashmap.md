If you are familiar with dictionary data type in python, then hash map is quite the same.
It consists of key value pairs.

The reason why hashmaps are powerful is because each key is unique.
And the key is calculated by hashing the key.
So to get the value of certain key we just have to pass in the key, the hash will be calculated and now we just have to retrieve the value corresponding to that hash.

This means the time complexity is O(1) constant, because we perform hash calculation each time regardless of the input data, and it's always the same number of operations.
