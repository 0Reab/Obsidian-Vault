In object oriented programming we can define the magic methods.
`__add__(self, something)`

These methods are preexisting, add being for example `object1 + object2`
Where you would naturally have some kind of error, because python has no idea what are you trying to do with your custom objects/classes.
In this case adding them together.
So by using dunder method (double underscore), you can tell python what to do in those use cases.
