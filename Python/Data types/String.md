A string would be a piece of written text.
For example: "Written text!" or 'Written text!123'

Strings can be encapsulated in either double or singe quotation marks.

Performing mathematical operations on strings doesn't work.
"2" + "2" will return "22" in form of a *string* not a [[Integer]]. 

Meaning you can *concatenate* strings like "not a " + "number".
