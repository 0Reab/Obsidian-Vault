This is a [[Conditional]] Loop.

Preforms loop *while* certain condition is met.
That condition can be something simple as evaluating [[Boolean Value]].

Example:
```python

arr = [1, 2, 3]

while True:
   print(arr)


Output:

[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]... 
Evaluating to True and printing the whole array forever.
