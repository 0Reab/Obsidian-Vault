Example task:

One day your supervisor walks to you, saying:
“here is the network ID 192.168.4.0/24, please create three separate networks or subnets for a coffee shop: Sunny Cafe.” 

The three separate subnets/networks are: 
One is for the office, one for the front desk and storage room, and one is for public use. Your task is to list each subnet network ID, subnet mask, Host ID Range, # of usable host IDs, and Broadcast ID. 
One last question: How many subnets are wasted after subnetting?
