Is used for automatic and dynamic assigning of [[IP address]] to computers in network.
For example for DHCP can be used instead of static [[IP address]] in domain environment.

Uses [[UDP]] because it cannot work on [[TCP]], there's no way to establish a connection before [[IP]] assignment to machines.
